	abstract = {The wireless sensor network "macroscope" offers the potential to advance science by
enabling dense temporal and spatial monitoring of large physical volumes. This paper
presents a case study of a wireless sensor network that recorded 44 days in the life
of a 70-meter tall redwood tree, at a density of every 5 minutes in time and every
2 meters in space. Each node measured air temperature, relative humidity, and photosynthetically
active solar radiation. The network captured a detailed picture of the complex spatial
variation and temporal dynamics of the microclimate surrounding a coastal redwood
tree. This paper describes the deployed network and then employs a multi-dimensional
analysis methodology to reveal trends and gradients in this large and previously-unobtainable
dataset. An analysis of system performance data is then performed, suggesting lessons
for future deployments.},
